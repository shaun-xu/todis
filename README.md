# Todis [ [中文](README_CN.md) ]

## 0. Open Source Community Version
Now(2021-11-14) users can build todis by himself, such build is community version which is full fledged but lacks performance sideplugins(topling SST & MemTab & Distributed Compaction), even lacks such components, todis works well and performance outperforms competitors.

**Open Source Community Version** is disallowed to be used by bytedance, see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## 1. Introduction
Todis is a massive, persistent Redis server developed by [Topling Inc.](https://topling.cn)

Currently(2021-10-11), there are many massive, persistent Redis server based on [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb), and many big company developed their private or open sourced  alternatives(massive, persistent Redis).

These alternative Redis servers are low performance and high cost, and lack of scalability, operationality, monitoring, ....

Todis are aimed on all such pain points, and accomplished these goals, users can experiencing [Managed Todis](https://topling.cn/products) based on aliyun in 10 minutes.

## 2. Features
1. Computing and Storage are seperated for elastic scaling
2. Auto scaling, no need for sharding/partitioning
3. Plenty monitoring metrics
4. Web view for DB internal stats

## 3. Performance
1. With elastic distributed compaction, kicked off write stalls, achieved sustained write speed over 100MB/s on a 2C16G cloud server
2. With searchable in memory compression technology([topling-zip](https://github.com/topling/topling-zip)), achieved very high read performance(saturate network bandwitdh)
3. With shared storage and engine level leader-follwer mechanics
   * Sync latency is lower to milliseconds
   * New follower(read only node) can be started and available in 10 seconds

## 4. Architeture
### 4.1. Redis layer of Todis
Redis layer is forked from pika with many improvements:
1. Strorage engine is replaced from [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) to [ToplingDB](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb)
2. Rewrite performance critical code of pika
3. Add many monitoring metrics(server side latency histogram for all commands and data len histogram...)
4. Adapt for [ToplingDB](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb) [SidePlugin](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki), and [Web view](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/WebView) for config and server stats
5. Adapt for [ToplingDB](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb) distributed compaction
### 4.2. Storage Engine layer ([ToplingDB](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb))
[ToplingDB](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb) is a storage engine developed by [Topling Inc.](https://topling.cn), which forked from [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) with many improvments:
1. [SidePlugin](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki), [Engine WebView](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/WebView), Monitoring Metrics...
2. [Distributed Compaction](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/Distributed-Compaction) which offload compaction to a dedicated cluster
   * In [Managed Todis](https://topling.cn/products), this cluster is shared by all users and all Todis instances
3. Topling SST and MemTab which based on [topling-zip](https://github.com/topling/topling-zip)(forked from [terark-zip](https://github.com/bytedance/))
   * [Rockeet](https://github.com/rockeet) is the founder of **Terark Inc.** and the author of terark-zip
   * **Terark Inc.** which was [acquired by bytedance at 2019](https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=%E5%AD%97%E8%8A%82%E8%B7%B3%E5%8A%A8%E6%94%B6%E8%B4%AD%E5%A5%87%E7%AE%80%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6)
   * Bytedance open sourced [terark-zip](https://github.com/bytedance/terark-zip) at the end of 2020
   * As the author of terark-zip, rockeet added many enhancements to [topling-zip](https://github.com/topling/topling-zip)(his fork of [terark-zip](https://github.com/bytedance/terark-zip)) since then

## 5. Compile
### 5.1 CentOS
```bash
sudo yum install epel-release -y
sudo yum config-manager --set-enabled powertools
sudo yum install git gcc-c++ glog-devel protobuf-devel libaio-devel -y
git clone https://github.com/topling/todis
cd todis
git submodule update --init --recursive
make -j`nproc`
```
If your `protobuf-devel` is too old, compilation maybe fail, you should update `protobuf-devel`, such as compile new protobuf from github source, or from vcpkg...

## 6. Deploy
Compiling generated dir `output` which included all files required at runtime, users need change config files(especially `path` items), there are two config files:
`todis-community.conf` and `todis-community.json`, the former is compatible for pika, the later is ToplingDB's SidePlugin conf for todis, `sideplugin-conf` of `todis-community.conf` is the path of `todis-community.json`.

The most simple way is to change all conf items prefixed with `/path/to/`.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Qihoo360/pika.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Qihoo360/pika) ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Qihoo360/pika/total)

## Introduction[中文](README_CN.md)

Pika is a persistent huge storage service , compatible  with the vast majority of redis interfaces ([details](https://github.com/Qihoo360/pika/wiki/pika-支持的redis接口及兼容情况)), including string, hash, list, zset, set and management interfaces. With the huge amount of data stored, redis may suffer for a capacity bottleneck, and pika was born for solving it. Except huge storage capacity, pika also support master-slave mode by slaveof command, including full and partial synchronization. You can also use pika together with twemproxy or codis(*pika has supported data migration in codis，thanks [left2right](https://github.com/left2right) and [fancy-rabbit](https://github.com/fancy-rabbit)*) for distributed Redis solution
